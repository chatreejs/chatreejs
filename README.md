# 👋🏻 Hi there
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Q5Q76NB0C)

Hello! I'm a **Software Engineer** driven by two core principles: **code quality** and **community contribution**.

I believe in **developer craftsmanship**—treating every line of code with intention, prioritizing resilience, and ensuring a fantastic experience for the next person who reads it (which is often future me!).

My passion lies in **open source**. I actively create and maintain projects designed to be useful, well-documented, and easy for new contributors to jump into. My goal is to **empower people** with reliable, free software.

## 📦 My Open Source Project

- [Bill-Please](https://github.com/chatreejs/bill-please): an app that will help you calculate your expenses and divide them up for your party.
- [Sushi](https://github.com/chatreejs/sushi): an app that will help you easily calculate the cost of your sushi meals at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.

* **Let's Collaborate:** Got an idea? Found a bug? I welcome contributions, discussions, and feedback on any of my projects!
